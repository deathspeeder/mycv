I am a professional platform architect focusing on big data and containerization technology. With more than 8 years of designing and developing various software, I am keen on implementing software and satisfying customersâ€™ needs. I have rich experiences in developing and managing distributed container systems and high load Web applications.

I have a Master Degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Bachelor Degree from Zhe Jiang University both majoring Software Engineering. My main skill set includes platform technologies such as J2EE, containerization (Docker), and distributed system. Programming languages involve most common and popular ones, like Scala, Java, Python, Bash, C++, JavaScript and HTML5.

I am flexible to project demands and shifting of priorities. Also I am good at handling tough tech issues and coming up with new ideas. Looking forward to working with you. Thanks!
