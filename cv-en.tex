\section{OBJECTIVE}
\cvline{}{A professional software engineer focusing on big data, containerization, distributed systems and DevOps. With more than 6 years of designing and developing various software systems and keen on implementing software and satisfying customers' needs. Eager, enthusiastic, focused and very good at trouble shooting. Looking for better designing and developing skills to build an excellent career in software engineering.}


\section{EXPERIENCE}
\cventry{Jan. '09 - Jun. '09}{Member}{The 4th Zhongkong robot competition simulation team}{Hangzhou}{}{Design and implement AI algorithms for several robots. Won Third-Grade Award in the competition. }
\cventry{Jun. '10 - Oct. '10}{Software Engineer Intern}{Augmentum Software Development (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.}{Shanghai}{}{Implement a testing framework for Windows desktop applications. Fix bugs for advertisement system.}
\cventry{Sep. '10 - Jun. '11}{Researcher}{Mining software repository for prediction of defects}{ZJU}{}{Research on computing software metrics, mining software repository, and defect prediction method. Improved C4.5 decision tree algorithm, experiment on open-source projects showed that the improved algorithm is better than existing ones. }
\cventry{Sep. '12 - Dec. '12}{Leader}{Research on Defect Prediction and Test Case Selection (Cooperation with Microsoft) }{SJTU}{}{Apply software defect prediction in test case selection. Slightly improved the efficiency of the selection. }
\cventry{Sep. '12 - Jun. '13}{PM}{Research Project Management System}{China Telecom (Shanghai)}{}{This project automates the research project management process. After integrated with existing OA systems, it supports functions like process automation, task distribution, document management, .etc. As a PM, I worked on analyzing requirements, designing prototype, implementing project application module and managing project team with 10 members. This project was finally accepted by our customer. }
\cventry{Sep. '12 - Jun. '13}{Leader}{Common Remote Sensing Data Processing Platform}{SJTU}{}{The platform supports user-define plug-ins while all image processing algorithm are implemented in these plug-ins. Together with proper plug-ins, the platform can identify, display and modify certain targets in the map. I played the chief technical leader in the project and delivered the project successfully. }
\cventry{Jun. '13 - Jul. '13}{PM Intern}{Microsoft Corporation}{Shanghai}{}{Design and implement a tool comparing the configurations between two server clusters and finally delivered the tool. }
